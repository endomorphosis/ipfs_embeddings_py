## Vector Quantization

Vector quantization techniques allow you to reduce the storage footprint and improve retrieval speed by compressing vector representations. The system supports several methods:

- **Scalar Quantization (SQ)** - Reduces precision of each dimension
- **Product Quantization (PQ)** - Splits vectors into sub-vectors and quantizes each separately
- **Optimized Product Quantization (OPQ)** - Applies a rotation matrix before PQ for better accuracy

Learn more in the [Vector Quantization](vector-quantization.md) guide.

## Sharding

Sharding distributes vector collections across multiple storage units, enabling:

- Handling larger-than-memory datasets
- Parallel processing for better throughput
- Higher fault tolerance and availability
- Scalability across multiple nodes

Learn more in the [Sharding](sharding.md) guide.
